        " 2. Docstring: The triple-quoted string right after the function definition is a docstring. It explains what the function does, its arguments (Args), what it returns (Returns), and any potential errors it might raise (Raises). This serves as documentation for the function.\n",
        " 3. Input Validation: if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n",
        "    .This is an important step for error handling. It checks if the input n is not an integer or if it's a negative number.\n",
        "    .If the input is invalid, it raises a ValueError with a descriptive message, indicating that the input must be a non-negative integer.\n",
        "4. Base Cases: if n <= 1:\n",
        "   .In recursion, base cases are essential to stop the recursive calls and prevent infinite loops.\n",
        "   . The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. So, if n is 0 or 1, the function directly returns n. These are the base cases: fibonacci(0) = 0 and fibonacci(1) = 1.\n",
        "5. Recursive Step: else: return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive (n - 2)\n",
        "6. Example Usage: The code then demonstrates how to use the fibonacci_recursive function with different values of n, including base cases and invalid inputs, and prints the results. The try...except block is used to gracefully handle the ValueError raised for invalid inputs.\n",
        " .In summary, the function breaks down the problem of finding the nth Fibonacci number into smaller, similar subproblems (finding the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers) until it reaches the base cases, and then it combines the results back up to find the final answer.\n"
